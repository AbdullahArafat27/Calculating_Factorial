# Calculating_Factorial
This C program calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using an iterative approach (for loop). The factorial function multiplies integers from 1 to n to compute the result. By default, it calculates the factorial of 10, but you can change the number in the main function to any integer. The result is printed to the console
